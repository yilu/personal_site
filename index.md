I am a post-doc at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/) of University of Heidelberg, working with [Prof. Maurits W. Haverkort](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~haverkort/). Before coming to Heidelberg, I did my graduate study in the [Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research](https://www.fkf.mpg.de/) under the supervision of [Prof. Bernhard Keimer](https://www.fkf.mpg.de/keimer). The main part of my research is about on x-ray spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated systems (most notably the transition-metal oxides). Details can be found in my [PhD thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-9246). You can also check out my [CV](_files/cv.pdf).

A considerable amount of my time in Heidelberg will also be spent on method developing, see [Quanty](http://quanty.org/) for details.
