I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/) of University of Heidelberg, working with [Prof. Maurits W. Haverkort](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~haverkort/). Before coming to Heidelberg, I obtained my Ph.D. in the [Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research](https://www.fkf.mpg.de/) under the supervision of [Prof. Bernhard Keimer](https://www.fkf.mpg.de/keimer). The main part of my research is developing theoretical and experimental methods for studying strongly correlated systems, with an emphasis on (x-ray) spectroscopy. Details can be found in my [PhD thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-9246). You can also check out my [CV](files/cv.pdf).

I am also part of the team behind the quantum many-body computation package [Quanty](http://quanty.org/). Quanty is a script language which allows the user to straightforwardly model and solve quantum many-body problems with little programming knowledge.
