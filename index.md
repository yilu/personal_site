I am a professor at the [physics department](https://physics.nju.edu.cn) of [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). My primary interest is correlated electron systems, with an emphasis on developing state-of-the-art numerical methods and applying them to complex many-body systems. Some of our work is materialized as a quantum many-body computation package [Quanty](http://quanty.org/), which allows users to straightforwardly model and solve quantum many-body problems with little programming knowledge.

<br>

Before joining Nanjing University, I obtained my Ph.D. in the group of [Prof. Bernhard Keimer](https://www.fkf.mpg.de/keimer) at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research (Germany), and subsequently worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Prof. Maurits W. Haverkort](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~haverkort/) at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/) of Heidelberg University (Germany).
